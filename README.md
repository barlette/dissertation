  Abstract: Technology scaling alongside the increasing process variability impact in modern technology nodes are the main reasons tocontrol 
deviations over metrics in IC nanometer designs. Also, given the increasing set of devices working in battery-oriented environments, energy 
consumption should be minimal and the operation regime reliable. Schmitt Triggers are traditionally used for noise immunity enhancement, and 
have been recently applied to mitigate radiation effects and process variability impact. However, Schmitt Trigger operation at the nominal 
voltage introduces higher power consumption, in comparison to an inverter, making the application of Schmitt Trigger in ultra low power 
applications difficult. Thus, this work main contribution is to trace the relationship between transistor sizing, supply voltage, and 
process variability to get a low energy consumption circuit while still keeping low levels of deviations due to the impact of process-
induced variability. The results are extracted from three different designs of inverters. All simulations are performed upon the extracted 
layouts design at 7-nm with the FinFET technology. Each layout presents a different number of fins, where each simulation presents a 
different level of variability and supply voltage. Amongst the several metrics considered - propagation times, energy, hysteresis interval, 
current ratios, voltage gains, and slopes - the energy is the prioritized metrics with an analysis considering different kinds of 
applications - low energy, low sensibility, and cost-benefit - being performed. Given so, it is shown that a cost-benefit analysis can 
highlight sets of sizing and supply voltage where it can provide a 37.51% decrease on energy consumption while only increasing its 
sensibility by 7.42%. Furthermore, it is presented that the dependence of supply voltage and sensibility to process variability is not 
directly related, with slight decreases in the supply voltages bringing better results. Considering the average measures, the inverter is 
still the fastest and most energy-efficient circuit, presenting the highest performance, lowest energy consumption, and smallest area. 
Although, when comparing noise immunity characteristics, the 6-Transistor Schmitt Trigger presents the highest noise margins and slopes, 
with higher current ratios, and gains. The TIST designs present the highest current ratios, gains, and hysteresis ratios. The improvements, 
although, may increase propagations times, energy consumption, and area.
